## Usage - Who's playing today?

The ojogo gem lets you query online sport.db (incl. football.db) HTTP JSON API services
for upcoming matches. For example,

    $ ojogo              # Defaults to today's world cup 2014 matches

prints on Jun/29 2014:

     Netherlands (NED) vs Mexico (MEX)
     Costa Rica (CRC) vs Greece (GRE)

That's it.


## Install

    $ gem install ojogo
