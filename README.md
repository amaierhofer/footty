## Usage - Who's playing today?

The footty gem lets you query online sport.db (incl. football.db) HTTP JSON API services
for upcoming matches. For example,

    $ footty              # Defaults to today's world cup 2018 matches

prints on Jun/14 2018:

     Russia (RUS) vs Saudi Arabia (KSA)   @ Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow

That's it.
